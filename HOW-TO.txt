Currently, all coding is done unit test driven. Well, at least it should ;-)

** Tools ** 

Apache Ant is used as the build tool.

** Compiling ** 

ant compile.vysper

** Running Unit Tests **

ant run-unit-tests

** Running the Server **

ant run-server

Server is started using class org.apache.vysper.spring.ServerMain

** Running a test client **

A Smack-based client can be run against the server by executing main class org.apache.vysper.smack.BasicClient
The client also opens a UI logging all stanzas
